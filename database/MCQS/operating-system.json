        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "When operands are specified in memory addressing mode, direct access to main memory, usually to the data segment, is required. This way of addressing results in slower processing of data. To get the exact location of data in memory, we need segment start address, which is found in the DS register and an offset value. This offset value is called an effective address.",
